== `Smsdid`: Supervisor Domain Identifier and Protection Register

`Smsdid` defines an interface to program the configuration for
supervisor-domain-related extensions. The interface consists of M-mode CSRs
`msdcfg` and `mmpt`. When `Smsdid` is implemented, both CSRs must be
implemented; `msdcfg` may be read-only zero if none of the optional supervisor
domain extensions are implemented.

The SDID programmed via the `mmpt` CSR is a local identifier for the
hart and may be used to tag hart-local resources to access-control data
associated with the supervisor domain. The SDID is unique only to a hart, hence
the SDID must not be used to tag downstream transactions that are globally
visible.

[NOTE]
====
For most typical usages, the SDID will remain stable over the life
of the supervisor domain. However, the SDID can be changed
at the cost of flushing any prior cached state that was
associated with the SDID.

=== Machine-level Memory Protection Tables (`mmpt`)

The `mmpt` register is an `MXLEN` wide read/write register, formatted as shown in
<<sdid-32>> for `MXLEN=32` and <<sdid-64>> for `MXLEN=64`, which controls
page-based physical address space protection. This register holds the
supervisor domain identifier (`SDID`); the physical page number (`PPN`) of the
root page of the memory protection tables (`MPT`), which facilitates page-based
address space protection; and the `MODE` field, which selects the memory
protection scheme for machine-level physical addresses.

Attempts to read or write `mmpt` while executing in U or S-mode will raise
an illegal instruction exception.

The number of implemented `SDID` bits is `UNSPECIFIED` and may be zero. The
number of implemented `SDID` bits, termed `SDIDLEN`, may be determined by
writing one to every bit position in the `SDID` field, then reading back the
value in `mmpt` to see which bit positions in the `SDID` field hold a one. The
least-significant bits of `SDID` are implemented first: that is, if
`SDIDLEN` > 0, `SDID`[`SDIDLEN`-1:0] is writable. The maximal value of
`SDIDLEN`, termed `SDIDMAX`, is 6.

Implementations are not required to support all defined `MODE` settings. A write
to `mmpt` with an unsupported `MODE` value is not ignored. Instead, the fields
of `mmpt` are `WARL` in the normal way, when so indicated in <<sdid-32>> and
<<sdid-64>>.

`mmpt.PPN` refers to the root of the memory protection table when `mmpt.MODE`
is not `Bare`.

When `mmpt.MODE` is `Smmpt64`, the root page of the memory protection table must
be aligned to a 32â€¯KiB boundary. In this mode, bits 2:0 of `mmpt.PPN` always read
as zero.

The `mmpt` register is considered active for the purposes of access type
permission lookup algorithm unless the effective privilege mode is `M`.

Note that writing `mmpt` does not imply any ordering constraint between
updates of virtual memory system page-tables or memory protection tables and
subsequent address translations or memory protection.

If an `MPT` structure for an address-space has been modified, or if a `SDID` is
reused, it may be necessary to execute a `MFENCE.MPA` instruction after, or in
some cases before, writing `mmpt`.

=== Machine Memory Protection Fence Instruction

....
{reg: [
  {bits:  7, name: 'opcode (SYSTEM)'},
  {bits:  5, name: 'rd (0)'},
  {bits:  3, name: 'func3 (PRIV)'},
  {bits:  5, name: 'rs1 (PADDR)'},
  {bits:  5, name: 'rs2 (SDID)'},
  {bits:  7, name: 'func7 (MFENCE.MPA)'},
], config:{lanes: 1, hspace:1024}}
....

The `MFENCE.MPA` fence instruction is used to synchronize updates to
memory protection tables with current execution of supervisor domains.
`MFENCE.MPA` is only valid in M-mode. If operand rs1!=x0, it specifies
a single machine-level physical address, and if rs2!=x0, it specifies
a single SDID.

The behavior of `MFENCE.MPA` depends on rs1 and rs2 as follows:

* If rs1=x0 and rs2=x0, the fence orders all reads and writes to any level
  of the MPTs for all supervisor domain address spaces.
* If rs1=x0 and rs2!=x0, the fence orders all reads and writes to any level
  of the MPT for the supervisor domain address space identified by the
  SDID in rs2.
* If rs1!=x0 and rs2=x0, the fence orders all reads and writes made to the
  leaf MPT entries that correspond to the physical address in rs1, for all
  supervisor domain address spaces.
* If rs1!=x0 and rs2!=x0, the fence orders all reads and writes made to the
  leaf MPT PTEs that correspond to the physical address in rs1, for the
  supervisor domain address space identified by the SDID in rs2.

Executing a `MFENCE.MPA` guarantees that any previous stores already visible to
the current hart are ordered before all implicit reads by that hart to memory
protection tables.

When SDID is specified in rs2, bits XLEN-1:SDIDMAX held in rs2 are reserved for
future standard use. Until their use is specified, they should be zeroed by
software and ignored by implementations. Also, if SDIDLEN < SDIDMAX, the
implementation shall ignore bits SDIDMAX-1:SDIDLEN of the value held in rs2.

[NOTE]
====
A simpler implementation of MFENCE.MPA may ignore the physical address in rs1,
and/or the SDID value in rs2, and always perform a global fence for all SDs.

=== M-mode Supervisor Domain Fine-Grain Invalidation Instruction

In some high-performance implementations, a finer-granular invalidation and
fencing is required that allows for synchronization operations to be more
efficiently batched. When `Svinval` is implemented with `Smsdid`, the
`MINVAL.MPA` instruction must be implemented to support such fine-granular
invalidation of cached MPT entries.

[caption="Figure {counter:image}: ", reftext="Figure {image}"]
[title="MINVAL.MPA instruction"]
[id=minval-spa]
[wavedrom, ,svg]
....
{reg: [
  {bits:  7, name: 'opcode (SYSTEM)'},
  {bits:  5, name: 'rd (0)'},
  {bits:  3, name: 'func3 (PRIV)'},
  {bits:  5, name: 'rs1 (PADDR)'},
  {bits:  5, name: 'rs2 (SDID)'},
  {bits:  7, name: 'func7 (MINVAL.MPA)'},
], config:{lanes: 1, hspace:1024}}
....

`MINVAL.MPA` is only ordered against `SFENCE.W.INVAL` and `SFENCE.INVAL.IR`
instructions.

The SFENCE.W.INVAL instruction guarantees that any previous stores already
visible to the current RISC-V hart are ordered before subsequent MINVAL.MPA
instructions executed by the same hart.

The SFENCE.INVAL.IR instruction guarantees that any previous MINVAL.MPA
instructions executed by the current hart are ordered before subsequent
implicit references by that hart to memory-protection data structures.

When executed in order (but not necessarily consecutively) by a single hart,
the sequence `SFENCE.W.INVAL`, `MINVAL.MPA` and `SFENCE.INVAL.IR` has the same
effect as a hypothetical `MFENCE.MPA` in which:

* the values of rs1 and rs2 for the `MFENCE.MPA` are the same as those used in
  the `MINVAL.MPA`,
* reads and writes prior to the `SFENCE.W.INVAL` are considered to be those
  prior to the `MINVAL.MPA`, and
* reads and writes following the `SFENCE.INVAL.IR` are considered to be those
  subsequent to the `MFENCE.MPA`

`MINVAL.MPA` is only valid in M-mode.

=== Extension to behavior of SFENCE.VMA, HFENCE.GVMA and HFENCE.VVMA

The behavior of the SFENCE.VMA, HFENCE.GVMA and HFENCE.VVMA instructions are
affected when the Smsdid extension is implemented.

When SFENCE.VMA is used within a supervisor domain, the virtual-address argument
is a virtual address with either the ASID being a S/HS-level ASID (V=0), or a
VS-level ASID (V=1).

For S/HS-level ASID, the virtual-address argument to SFENCE.VMA is a host
virtual address within the current supervisor domain, and the ASID argument is
a S/HS-level ASID within the current supervisor domain. The current supervisor
domain is identified by the SDID field of the CSR mmpt, and the effective ASID
can be considered the combination of the SDID and the S/HS-level ASID. The
SFENCE.VMA orders stores only to this S/HS-level address-translation structures
with subsequent S/HS-level address translations.

When V=1, the virtual-address argument to SFENCE.VMA is a guest virtual address
within the current virtual machine, and the ASID argument is a VS-level ASID
within the current virtual machine. The current virtual machine is identified by
the SDID field of the CSR mmpt and the VMID field of CSR hgatp. The effective
ASID within this virtual machine can be considered to be the combination of this
SDID and VMID along with the VS-level ASID. The SFENCE.VMA instruction orders
stores only to the VS-level address-translation structures with subsequent
VS-stage address translations for the same virtual machine, i.e., only when
mmpt.SDID and the hgatp.VMID is the same as when the SFENCE.VMA executed.

For HFENCE.GVMA, the guest-physical address argument is within the context of
the current virtual machine identified by the combination of the SDID field of the
CSR mmpt and the VMID value in rs2. Executing an HFENCE.GVMA guarantees
that any previous stores already visible to the current hart are ordered before
all implicit reads by that hart done for G-stage address translation for
instructions that follow the HFENCE.GVMA, and execute with the same mmpt.SDID
and hgatp.VMID when HFENCE.GVMA executed.

For HFENCE.VVMA, the guest-virtual address argument is within the context of
the current virtual machine identified by the combination of the ASID value
in rs2, the VMID field of CSR hgatp, and the SDID field of CSR mmpt.
Executing an HFENCE.VVMA guarantees that any previous stores already visible to
the current hart are ordered before all implicit reads by that hart done for
VS-stage address translations for instructions that are subsequent to the
HFENCE.VMMA and execute when hgatp.VMID and mmpt.SDID have the same setting as
it did when HFENCE.VVMA executed.

=== Extension to behavior of `Svinval`

When `Svinval` is implemented with `Smsdid` the behavior of SINVAL.VMA is
modified to also use the SDID from the CSR mmpt in addition to the ASID provided
in SINVAL.VMA.

When the `Hypervisor` extension is also implemented, the behavior of HINVAL.VVMA
and HINVAL.GVMA is modified to also use the SDID from the CSR mmpt in addition
to the VMID provided in the HINVAL.GVMA or the ASID provided in HINVAL.VVMA.

=== Machine supervisor domain configuration (`msdcfg`)

The `msdcfg` is a MXLEN wide read/write register, formatted as shown in <<MSDCFG>>
for RV64 and in <<MSDCFG32>> for RV32. This CSR is used by M-mode software to
specify the active configuration for capabilities of the supervisor domain when
associated with a hart.  The following extensions use the `msdcfg` register to
specify additional configuration for supervisor domains:

. `Smsdia` uses `msdcfg.SIDN` to identify the _supervisor interrupt domain_
  associated with the hart.
. `Smsdedbga` specifies the `msdcfg.SEDA` bit to allow external-debug for
  supervisor domains.
. `Smsdetrca` specifies the `msdcfg.SETA` bit to allow external-trace for
  supervisor domains.

Details of `Smsdia`, `Smsdedbga`, and `Smsdetrca` are described in
their respective sections in this specification. For any optional extensions not
implemented, the corresponding configuration bits in `msdcfg` are read-only
zero. Hence if no optional extensions are implemented, this CSR becomes
read-only zero.
