== `Smsdid`: Supervisor Domain Identifier and Protection Register

`Smsdid` defines an interface to program the active supervisor domain
under which a hart is operating. The interface consists of M-mode CSRs `msdcfg`
and `mttp`. The SDID programmed via this interface is a local identifier for the
hart and may be used to tag hart-local resources to access-control data
associated with the supervisor domain.

The `mttp` register is an `XLEN`-bit read/write register, formatted as shown in
<<sdid-32>> for `XLEN=32` and <<sdid-64>> for `XLEN=64`, which controls
physical address protection for supervisor domains. This register holds the
physical page number (`MTTPPN`) of the root page of the memory tracking table
(`MTT`), a supervisor domain identifier (`SDID`), which facilitates address
protection fences on a per-supervisor-domain basis; and the `MODE` field, which
selects the address protection scheme (MTT Mode to be enforced) for physical
addresses. The MTT is a structure that holds the access permissions for a
physical address and is looked up per the programmed `MODE`.

Attempts to read or write `mttp` while executing in U, S or HS-mode will raise
an illegal instruction exception.

<<mtt-32>> shows the encodings of the `MODE` field when `XLEN=32` and
<<mtt-64>> shows the encodings of the `MODE` field when `XLEN=64`. When `mttp`
`MODE=Bare`, supervisor physical addresses have no MTT-based protection across
supervisor domains beyond the physical memory protection scheme described in
Section 3.7 of the RISC-V privileged architecture specification [1]. In this
case, the remaining fields (`SDID`, `MTTPPN`) in `mttp` must be set to zeros,
else generate a fault. When `XLEN=32`, the other valid settings for `MODE` are
`Smmtt34` and `Smmtt34rw`, to support allow/disallow and read-write access
permissions for 34-bit system physical addresses.

When `XLEN=64`, other than `BARE`, the other valid settings for `MODE` are
`Smmtt[46, 56][rw]` to support read-write/access permissions for 46-bit and
56-bit system physical addresses.

The remaining `MODE` settings when `XLEN=64` are `reserved` for future use and
may define different interpretations of the other fields in `mttp`.

Implementations are not required to support all defined `MODE` settings when
`XLEN=64`. A write to `mttp` with an unsupported `MODE` value is not ignored.
Instead, the fields of `mttp` are `WARL` in the normal way, when so indicated.

The `MTTPPN` refers to an `MTTL3` table or an `MTTL2` table based on physical
address width (`PAW`). For 56 \<= `PAW` < 46, `MTTL3` table must be of size
`2^(PAW-43)` bytes and naturally aligned to that sized byte boundary. For 46
\<= `PAW` < 32 the `MTTL2` table must be of size 2^(`PAW`-23) or 2^(`PAW`-22)
bytes (depending on the Smmtt `MODE` selected) and must be naturally aligned to
that sized byte boundary. In these modes, the lowest two bits of the physical
page number (`MTTPPN`) in `mttp` always read as zeros.

The number of `SDID` bits is `UNSPECIFIED` and may be zero. The number of
implemented `SDID` bits, termed `SDIDLEN`, may be determined by writing one to
every bit position in the `SDID` field, then reading back the value in `mttp`
to see which bit positions in the `SDID` field hold a one. The
least-significant bits of `SDID` are implemented first: that is, if `SDIDLEN` >
0, `SDID`[`SDIDLEN`-1:0] is writable. The maximal value of `SDIDLEN`, termed
`SDIDMAX`, is 8 for `Smmtt34[rw]` or 16 for `Smmtt46[rw]`, `Smmtt56[rw]`.

The `mttp` register is considered active for the purposes of the physical
address protection algorithm unless the effective privilege mode is `M`.

Note that writing `mttp` does not imply any ordering constraints between
`S-mode` and `G-stage` page-table updates and subsequent address translations.
If a supervisor domain's `MTT` structure has been modified, or if a `SDID` is
reused, it may be necessary to execute a `FENCE.MTT` instruction before or
after writing `mttp`.

=== Machine supervisor domain configuration (`msdcfg`)

The `msdcfg` is a 32-bit read/write register, formatted as shown in <<MSDCFG>>.
This CSR is used by M-mode software to specify the active configuration for
capabilities of the supervisor domain when associated with a hart. +
The following extensions use the `msdcfg` register to specify additional
configuration for supervisor domains:

. `Smsdia` uses `msdcfg.SDICN` to specify the active configuration for
  the supervisor domain interrupt controller associated with the hart.
. `Smsdedbg` specifies the `msdcfg.sdedbgalw` bit to manage
  external-debug for a supervisor domain.
. `Smsdetrc` specifies the `msdcfg.sdetrcalw` bit to manage
  external-trace for a supervisor domain.
. `Smqosid` specifies the control bits `SSM`, `SRL`, `SML` and `SQRID` to enable
  the RDSM to manage QoS controls for supervisor domains.

Details of `Smsdia`, `Smsdedbg`, `Smsdetrc` and `Smqosid` are described in their
respective sections in this specification.
