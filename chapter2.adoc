==  Summary of extensions for Supervisor Domain Access Protection

The following normative architecture extensions are defined.

* `Smsdid` (<<Smsdid>>) - An interface to program the active supervisor domain
under which a hart is operating. This is a dynamic control state on the hart
that is held in an machine-mode CSR and modifiable by the RDSM via CSR r/w
instructions  - herewith called the `supervisor domain identifier` assigned to
the hart. The SDID is a local identifier for the hart and may be used to tag
hart-local resources to access-control data associated with the supervisor
domain. The supervisor domain identifier is independent from the hart privilege
levels and is held in a machine-mode CSR. This extension may be
used independently or may be combined with other extensions in this
specification.

* `Smmpt` (<<Smmpt>>) - An extension to set the access permissions for a memory
region or page associated with a supervisor domain. This extension allows for
dynamic changes of access permission. Such dynamic changes may require flushing
of appropriate state cached in harts. The access properties are programmed via
a Machine-level Memory Protection Tables (MPT) structure. The physical page
number (PPN) of the root table of the MPT is programmed into a machine-mode CSR. When
`Smmpt` is implemented, MPT and e(PMP) are always active. Although there is no
option to disable MPT, it can be effectively disabled if granular memory access
control is not required by configuring MPT mode to be `Bare`.

* `IO-MPT` (<<IO-MPT>>) - A non-ISA extension that enables programming of an IO
interconnect to associate an IOMMU and devices in scope of that IOMMU with a SD.
The assignment of IOMMUs to supervisor domains is also expected to be under the
purview of the RDSM. IO-MPT extension specifies the memory access control
mechanisms for memory accesses performed by the IOMMU as well as by the devices
associated with that SD. Note that isolation of data within a device is
out of scope of this specification.

* `Smsdia` (<<Smsdia>>) - This extension enables assignment of IMSIC
interrupt file(s) or an APLIC domain to a supervisor domain. The extension also
provides CSRs to allow machine-mode software to retain control on notification of
interrupts when Supervisor domains are enabled.

* `Smsdedbga` (<<Smsdedbga>>) - This extension provides the controls to indicate
if external debug is allowed for a supervisor domain. Whether external debug is
authorized or not is expected to be done via a root of trust (RoT) and is
outside the scope of this specification.

* `Smsdetrca` (<<Smsdedbga>>) - This extension provides the controls to indicate
if external trace is allowed for a supervisor domain. Whether external trace is
authorized or not is expected to be done via a root of trust (RoT) and is
outside the scope of this specification.

* `Smsqosid` and CBQRI for Supervisor Domains (<<Smsdqos>>) - This extension
provides an interface for the RDSM to enforce that resource accesses from a
supervisor domain or the RDSM must not be observable by entities that are not
within their TCB using the resource usage monitors. Similarly, the resource
allocations for a supervisor domain or the RDSM must not be influenced by
entities outside their TCB.
