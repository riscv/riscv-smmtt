==  Summary of extensions for Supervisor Domain Access Protection

=== Architecture Extensions

The following normative architecture extensions are defined. The following
sub-section describes the (informative) theory of operation.

* `Smsdid` (<<Smsdid>>) - An interface to signal the active supervisor domain
under which a hart is operating. This is a dynamic control state on the hart
that can be held in an M-mode CSR and modifiable by the RDSM via CSR r/w
instructions  - herewith called the `supervisor domain identifier` assigned to
the hart. Supervisor domains are orthogonal to hart privilege levels and since
Smmtt enables physical memory isolation, there is one CSR (per hart) managed by
M-mode. Device side accesses are addressed in the `IO-MTT` extension. Isolation
of data within a device is out of scope of this specification.

* `Smmtt` (<<Smmtt>>) - An interface to set the access permissions for a memory
region or page associated with a supervisor domain. This interface allows
dynamic changes of association (which may require appropriate flushing of any
state cached in harts). The association mapping is programmed via an Memory
Tracking Table (MTT) structure, accessed via per-hart M-mode CSRs and which may
be backed by additional in-memory structures. The M-mode CSR interface is
expected to program the root physical page (MTTPPN) - for when the MTT is a
memory-based structure, the MTTPPN would hold the physical address of the root
page of the MTT structure in memory - the MTT is expected to be memory resident
at time of access. Write access to MTT structures must be restricted by and to
the RDSM (except for when explicitly allowed by the RDSM). Privilege levels may
affect changes in the MTT under purview of the Supervisor Domain Security
Manager (SDSM) either through an SBI interface into M-mode (or may have the
ability to edit MTT structures by virtue of how the MTT structure in memory is
accessible to lower privilege levels).

* `Svpams` (<<Svpams>>) - Physical address metadata selector - When access to
memory that is shared by one or more supervisor domains is allowed by the MTT,
the access may need to be additionally qualified to enforce security-controls.
`Svpams` enables specifying a physical address metadata selector as part of the
access. The possible metadata are specified in (per-hart) CSRs managed by the
RDSM. The metadata that is associated with the accessed physical address is
selected via a physical address metadata selector (`PAMS`) field programmed into
the page table entry (S-mode or G-stage) traversed as part of the address
translation. The supervisor domain S/HS-mode software is expected to manage the
S-mode/G-stage page table PAMS fields.

* `IO-MTT` (<<IO-MTT>>) - This non-ISA interface enables programming of an IO
interconnect to associate SDID to IOMMU ID (called the SD Classifier). The
assignment of IOMMUs to supervisor domains is also expected to be under the
purview of the RDSM. IO-MTT interface specifies the memory access interface for
physical-addresses encountered during IOMMU address translation as well for the
final physical address of access.

* `Smsdia` (<<Smsdia>>) - This M-mode CSR interface enables assignment of IMSIC
S-interrupt file or an APLIC domain to a Supervisor Domain. The interface also
describes CSRs to allow M-mode software to retain control on notification of
interrupts when Supervisor domains are enabled.

* `Smsdedbg` (<<Smsdedbg>>) - This extension defines the external debug
configuration interface that is managed by M-mode software to declare that
external debug is allowed for a supervisor domain. Whether external debug is
authorized or not is expected to be done via a RoT and is outside the scope
of this specification.

=== Theory of operation (informative)
Supervisor Domain Access Protection extensions are used by M-mode software to
program if physically-addressed memory (or device-mapped region) is
accessible (read/write) by a hart/device operating under the control of S-mode
software within a domain. Associating a hart/device with a supervisor domain
implies that any physical-addressable region accesses occurring in the context
of the supervisor domain is subject to access-checks for that domain.
Hence, software or hardware accesses that originate from other supervisor
domains other than the owner supervisor domain can be explicitly
prevented/allowed by using the Smmtt extension. The RDSM has access to physical
memory for all supervisor domains.

Memory regions may be accessed by harts or by other devices on the platform.
When harts and devices are assigned to a supervisor domain, the hart/device is
said to perform memory accesses in the context of that supervisor domain. For
all accesses using a physical address, the SDID is the supervisor domain
identifier programmed into a CSR.  This CSR is programmed on the hart by the
Root Domain Security Manager (RDSM). The assignment of the hart/device to a
supervisor domain may be static (e.g. device assignment to a VM) or dynamic
(e.g. scheduling a VM virtual cpu within a domain). The MTT for the supervisor
domain active on the hart is programmed on the hart along with the supervisor
domain identifier. The MTT does not perform any address translation; it simply
provides access permissions for the physically addressed region/page (post any
S-mode and/or G-stage address translation) to enforce the isolation properties
per the use case requirements (see <<mtt-lookup>>).

The MTT checker is a functional block that looks up the MTT using the physical
address of the access as an index to retrieve the access permissions for the
supervisor domain. This checker thus enforces that for a load initiated by the
hart, the physical address is readable, and for a store initiated by the hart,
the physical address is also writable, else reports a fault. An access
violation is reported as a trap to the supervisor domain and may be handled by
the M-mode Root domain security manager. Such disallowed accesses are ideally
handled with no data divulged. This MTT checker may be implemented
as an MMU extension in the hart, and/or in the IO interconnect to check device
accesses. The MTT checker is designed to work together with the page-based
virtual memory (MMU, IOMMU) systems and Physical Memory Protection
(PMP, IOPMP) mechanisms. Read and Write permissions for memory are derived from
the page table, the PMP and the MTT - an access is allowed only when all
protection mechanisms allow the access. When paging is enabled, instructions
that access virtual memory may result in multiple physical-memory accesses,
including (implicit S-mode) accesses to the page tables. MTT checks also apply
to these implicit accesses - those accesses will be treated as reads for
translation and as writes when A/D bits are updated in page table entries when
`Svadu` is implemented.

MTTs are checked by the MTT checker for all accesses to eligible
physical memory, including accesses that have undergone virtual to
physical memory translation, but excluding MTT structure accesses. The
MTT checker indexes the MTT using the physical address of the access to
retrieve the access permissions, and checks that the hart or device is allowed
to access the physical memory accessed. A mismatch of the access type and
the access permissions specified in the MTT entry that applies to the
accessed region is reported as a trap to the supervisor domain software or
to the RDSM and the access is
disallowed with no data divulged. As described above, to support
architectural virtual address page sizes, the MTT allows configuration
at those supported architectural page sizes. MTT violations manifest as
instruction, load, or store access-fault exceptions. The exception
conditions for MTT are checked when the access to memory is performed.

MTT may be used to provide permissions for physical memory addresses
that hold regular main memory or IO memory. Memory may be assigned to
the RDSM to bootstrap the subsequent run-time lookup structures for MTT.
All memory should be covered by the MTT, though some memory may not be
eligible to be qualified for assignment to a specific supervisor domain.
This limitation may arise due to platform configuration and security
policies - for example, if the platform security policy requires memory
for a domain to be encrypted and some memory access paths are not
enforced via an inline memory encryption engine. It is expected that the
RDSM can use trusted platform-specific methods to enumerate which
regions can be designated as access-controlled via the MTT.

MTT must support both static and run-time configurability. A memory
region (consisting of one or more pages) may be (re)assigned from one
domain to another at run-time e.g. this is done by revoking the
permission for one domain and assigning permissions to another domain.
Run-time configuration may be performed via M-mode CSRs and/or in-memory
structures. The in-memory structures used for MTT must themselves be
access-limited to the RDSM by use of the MTT structures to disallow any
supervisor domain from accessing the structures unless explicitly
delegated by the Root Domain Security Manager (RDSM) to a particular
domain (per use case policies). To support MTT dynamic reconfiguration,
an interface is expected to be provided to set the attributes by passing
requests to a trusted driver (in the RDSM) that can reconfigure the
memory region assignment. Converting memory regions assignment from one
domain to another might involve platform-specific operations based on
the enforcement mechanism, such as TLB/cache flushes, that must be
enforced by the RDSM and hardware. The RDSM is expected to change the
settings and flush caches if necessary, so the system is only incoherent
during the transition between domain assignment settings. This
transitory state should not be visible to lower privilege levels (i.e.
supervisor domains). There are also security aspects to be considered during
(re)configuration, e.g., clearing memory used by the current SD before
assigning it to another SD. Refer to the RISC-V CoVE <<R4>> ABI and threat
model as a reference.

A hart/device may perform accesses to memory exclusively accessible to it's
supervisor domain, or to memory shared globally with one or more supervisor
domains. Memory sharing between supervisor domains is achieved by simply making
the physical memory region accessible to the supervisor domains via the MTT
structure associated with the hart or device. Access to physical addresses
initiated from a hart or a device assigned a supervisor domain identifier may be
denied by virtue of the permissions in the MTT lookup - such disallowed accesses
cause a trap which may be reported to the supervisor domain software or to the
RDSM to report a fault.

The intra-domain isolation of memory between two harts/devices belonging
to the same supervisor domain, but different tenant workloads, is
achieved via the use of MMU, (S)PMP, IOMMU and IOPMP depending on the
type of platform and the type of access. To successfully achieve this
isolation, the page table structures for a domain's workloads must be
managed by the Supervisor Domain Security Manager (SDSM) and the paging
structures must be located in memory exclusively-accessible only to the
Supervisor Domain. Additional security properties may be enforced based
on type (data fetch, instruction fetch, etc.) and locality (hart
supervisor domain identifier) of memory accesses as required for the
security policy specific to usages. An example policy may be to require
certain accesses to target only exclusively-owned domain memory. The MTT
checker may utilize the supervisor domain identifier or additional metadata
for the access to enforce such policies. The description of different types
of Supervisor Domain policies possible is outside the scope of this document.

Additional protection/isolation for memory associated with a supervisor domain
is orthogonal (and usage-specific). Such additional protection for memory may
be derived by the use of cryptography and/or access-control mechanisms. The
mechanisms chosen for these additional protection methods are independent of
Smmtt and may be platform-specific, though they may utilize the physical
address metadata selected (via the Svpams extension) during the access. The TCB
of a particular supervisor domain (and devices that are bound to it) may be
independently evaluated via attestation of the HW and SW TCB by a relying party
using standard Public-Key Infrastructure-based mechanisms.
